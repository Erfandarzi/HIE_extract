ABSTRACT
OBJECTIVE. The goals were to identify predictor variables and to develop scoring
systems and classification trees to predict death/disability or death in infants with
hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy.
METHODS. Secondary analysis of data from the multicenter, randomized, controlled,
National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Neonatal Research
Network trial of hypothermia in hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy was performed. Data for 205 neonates diagnosed as having hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy were studied. Logistic regression analysis was performed by using clinical
and laboratory variables available within 6 hours of birth, with death or moderate/
severe disability at 18 to 22 months or death as the outcomes. By using the
identified variables and odds ratios, scoring systems to predict death/disability or
death were developed, weighting each predictor in proportion to its odds ratio. In
addition, classification and regression tree analysis was performed, with recursive
partitioning and automatic selection of optimal cutoff points for variables. Correct
classification rates for the scoring systems, classification and regression tree models, and early neurologic examination were compared.
RESULTS. Correct classification rates were 78% for death/disability and 71% for death
with the scoring systems, 80% and 77%, respectively, with the classification and
regression tree models, and 67% and 73% with severe encephalopathy in early
neurologic examination. Correct classification rates were similar in the hypothermia and control groups.
CONCLUSIONS. Among neonates diagnosed as having hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, the classification and regression tree model, but not the scoring system, was
superior to early neurologic examination in predicting death/disability. The 3
models were comparable in predicting death. Only a few components of the early
neurologic examination were associated with poor outcomes. These scoring systems and classification trees, if validated, may help in assessments of prognosis and
may prove useful for risk-stratification of infants with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy for clinical trials.

HYPOXIC-ISCHEMIC ENCEPHALOPATHY (HIE) is a major
contributor to neonatal death and morbidity. An
estimated 23% of the 4 million neonatal deaths1 and 8%
of all deaths at 5 years of age throughout the world
each year are associated with signs of asphyxia at birth.2
Even at referral centers in developed countries, death or
moderate to severe disability occurs for 53% to 61% of
infants diagnosed as having moderate to severe HIE.3,4
Statements about prognoses in HIE are usually based on
neurologic examinations. Sarnat and Sarnat5 described 3
clinical stages of encephalopathy, and they and others
have reported that infants with mild (stage 1) encephalopathy rarely have persistent neurologic impairment, as
seen for a majority of infants with severe (stage 3) encephalopathy. Infants with moderate encephalopathy
have an intermediate risk of persistent neurologic impairment.5–7 Children with moderate/severe neonatal
encephalopathy are at risk for reduced school performance, whereas those with mild encephalopathy have
school performance scores similar to those of their
peers.6 Despite the fact it has been shown to be highly
predictive of outcomes,5–7 one limitation of the staging
described by Sarnat and Sarnat5 is that the stage is usually assigned well after birth; no studies have evaluated
the predictive value of early neurologic evaluations. It is
extremely important to validate the use of neurologic
examinations in the early hours after resuscitation for
recruitment for therapeutic trials and to examine
whether additional clinical data can strengthen predictions.
A recent randomized, controlled trial of hypothermia
in infants with HIE, conducted by the National Institute
of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) Neonatal Research Network, enrolled 208 term infants and
demonstrated reductions in rates of death and moderate/severe disability, with an absolute risk reduction of
18% (number needed to treat  6) and a relative risk
reduction of 29%.3 This trial provided a unique opportunity to develop a scoring system, because this was a
multicenter trial with a relatively large sample size from
tertiary care NICUs in recent years. In addition, all of the
enrolled infants had neurologic evaluations performed
by certified physician examiners before enrollment, detailed histories, and follow-up evaluations performed by
certified examiners at 18 to 22 months of age. Because
hypothermia reduces rates of death and morbidity attributable to HIE and hypothermia needs to be initiated
soon after birth to be effective,8–10 it is of clinical importance to ascertain prognosis soon after birth and, if possible, to identify a subset of neonates for whom hypothermia may be more beneficial.
Our objectives were to identify predictor variables
and to develop scoring systems and prognostic algorithms for HIE in term infants and to compare their
predictive values with that of severe encephalopathy, as
diagnosed through the early neurologic examinations
used in the NICHD Neonatal Research Network hypothermia trial. A secondary goal was to determine the
precooling attributes that alone or in combination could
predict infants for whom hypothermia might be of
greater benefit.
METHODS
Subjects
This study was a secondary analysis of data from the
NICHD Hypothermia Trial.3 Infants were screened if they
were of gestational age of 36 weeks and were admitted
to the NICU at 6 hours of age, with either poor respiratory effort at birth and a need for resuscitation or a
diagnosis of encephalopathy. Infants were evaluated according to physiologic criteria and then through a neurologic examination. Eligibility criteria included pH of
7.0 or base deficit of 16 mmol/L in cord blood or
during the first 1 hour after birth. If, during this interval,
the pH was between 7.01 and 7.15, the base deficit was
between 10 and 15.9 mmol/L, or an arterial blood gas
value was not available, then additional criteria were
required (an acute perinatal event and either a 10-
minute Apgar score of 5 or assisted ventilation for 10
minutes from birth). Once these criteria were met, all
infants underwent a standardized neurologic examination (Table 1), performed by a certified physician examiner. Encephalopathy was defined as 1 sign in at least
3 of the 6 categories. The number of moderate or severe
signs determined the degree of encephalopathy; if signs
were distributed equally, then the designation was based
on the level of consciousness.3 Moderate or severe encephalopathy or seizures qualified infants for the trial.3
Follow-up Evaluation and Outcome Definitions
During the 18- to 22-month follow-up visit, a comprehensive history, physical examination, and neurodevelopmental assessment11 were performed by trained and
certified personnel who were masked to the infant’s
group assignment. Gross motor function was graded according to the gross motor function classification system
(GMFCS)12 (level 1: walks independently with some gait
abnormalities; level 2: unable to walk but can sit, pull to
standing, and cruise; level 3: unable to walk or crawl,
uses hands for sitting support; level 4: needs support for
sitting; level 5: requires adult assistance to move). Early
cognitive functioning was assessed with the Bayley
Scales of Infant Development II.13 Severe disability was
defined as any of the following: a mental development
index score of 70, a GMFCS grade of level 3 to 5,
hearing impairment requiring hearing aids, or blindness.
Moderate disability was defined as a mental development index score of 70 to 84, in addition to 1 of the
following: a GMFCS grade of level 2, hearing impairment with no amplification, or a persistent seizure disorder.

o
Model Development
Complementary approaches of logistic regression analysis and classification and regression tree (CART) analysis
were used for development of the scoring systems and
prognostic algorithms, respectively. Clinical and laboratory variables available at the time of initial evaluation
(6 hours of age), including components of the early
neurologic evaluation, were used for development of the
models (Table 2). Separate logistic regression analysis
with stepwise selection of variables (at P  .1) identified
variables in the entire cohort associated with death/
moderate/severe disability and death (SAS 9.0; SAS Institute, Cary, NC). The variables identified by stepwise
regression were used to develop a logistic regression
model for predicting the outcome of interest. The odds
ratios from this logistic regression model were converted
into point totals of 1 by dividing each odds ratio by the
smallest odds ratio for any given level of a variable. Next,
an overall score was assigned to each infant by summing
the points they received for their various levels of each
variable in the model. An infant with a missing value for
any source variable was given a missing value for the
overall score, because omission of an item would result
in a lower score. Models with imputed values for the
missing values were also tested but were not used because they did not demonstrate better accuracy. Continuous variables (eg, base deficit) were divided into 3
categories by developing a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for the variable with respect to the
outcome of interest and identifying the cutoff points for
80% sensitivity and 80% specificity. These scoring systems were applied to the entire cohort, the hypothermia
cohort, and the control cohort separately. On the basis of
the mutually exclusive ranges of scores, we identified (1)
the score below which all infants had good outcomes
(absence of either death/moderate/severe disability or
death, depending on the model) even without hypothermia, (2) the score range in which infants might have
benefited from hypothermia (all infants in the hypothermia group had good outcomes but some infants in the
control group had poor outcomes), (3) the score range in
which the benefit is less clear (poor outcomes were

noted for some control infants and infants in the hypothermia group), and (4) the score above which all infants died or were disabled despite hypothermia.
Prognostic algorithms were developed by using CART
analysis. CART models were created with AnswerTree
(SPSS, Chicago, IL), which performed recursive partitioning and automatic selection of optimal cutoff points
for variables. The CART algorithm in this program is
based on the method developed by Brieman et al.14 To
select the tree, the Gini impurity function was used with
a minimal change in impurity of 0.0001. The same variables used for stepwise variable selection for the logistic
regression model (Table 2) were used for CART model
development. The maximal tree depth was set empirically at 10 levels, with a minimal number of 20 observations in each parent (upper) node and 10 observations
in each child (lower) node. Although the CART method
for constructing the models may be complex and most
clinicians are not familiar with the CART method, the
resulting decision trees are simple to use and are similar
to algorithms used in most clinical guidelines. Correct
classification rates and other indicators of validity were
calculated for the scoring systems (at the optimal point
for both sensitivity and specificity, as identified with the
ROC curve), the CART models, and the “severe encephalopathy” stage in early neurologic evaluation for the
entire cohort, the hypothermia cohort, and the control
cohort; 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated
for the correct classification rates by bootstrapping with
a sample size of 150 (for the entire cohort) or 75 (for the
hypothermia or control cohorts) and 1000 resamplings.
RESULTS
Study Group
Of the 205 infants with primary outcome data, 172
infants (excluding 33 infants with missing data for the
selected predictor variables) could be analyzed for the
outcome of death/disability and 171 (excluding 34 with
missing data) could be analyzed for the outcome of
death. Missing data were mainly variables from the first
postnatal blood gas analyses, which were not recorded
despite other variables from those blood gas analyses
being recorded. Infants with missing data, after adjustment for center, were comparable to those with available data with respect to nonmissing variables. Of the
172 infants analyzed for death or disability, 88 (51%)
either died or were diagnosed as having disability; of the
171 infants analyzed for the outcome of death, 54 (32%)
died.
Scoring Systems
The predictor variables, odds ratios, and scores assigned
to each variable for death/disability scoring are shown in
Table 3, and those for death scoring are shown in Table
4. For death/disability, the most influential variables, in
order of highest odds ratios were decerebrate posture,
base deficit of 22 mmol/L in first postnatal blood gas
analysis, 5-minute Apgar score of 4, absence of spontaneous activity, and absence of chronic hypertension/
pregnancy-induced hypertension. For death, the most
influential variables were base deficit of 22 mmol/L in
first postnatal blood gas analysis, decerebrate or distal
flexion posture, absence of suck reflex, and absence of
maternal antepartum hemorrhage.
The models had high accuracy in both the hypothermia and control cohorts and in the entire cohort for
death/disability (for entire cohort: area under the ROC
curve: 0.85; 95% CI: 0.79 – 0.91) and death (area under
the curve: 0.81; 95% CI: 0.73– 0.88). Overlap of the 95%
CIs was noted for the correct classification rates for the
scoring systems and early neurologic examination (Tables 5 and 6). The correct classification rates were comTABLE 3 Predictor Variables, Odds Ratios, and Scores Assigned to Each Variable for Death/Disability

parable in the hypothermia and control groups (Tables 5
and 6). Higher scores were associated with worse outcomes. For the death/disability score, the score thresholds below which all infants survived without disability
were 28 (95% CI: 24 –32) in the hypothermia group and
23 (95% CI: 18 –29) in the control group. Cutoff points
of 23 (95% CI: 19 –27), 29 (95% CI: 27–32), and 52
(95% CI: 46 –58) divided the death/disability scores
(range: 9 – 65 for entire cohort) into 4 categories (Table
3), as follows: good prognosis, score of 23: all infants
survived without moderate/severe disability even without hypothermia (12% of all enrolled infants were in
this range); probable benefit, score of 23 to 28: all infants
in the hypothermia group but not in the control group
survived without disability (13% of enrolled infants);
possible benefit, score of 29 to 52: some infants in both
the hypothermia and control groups died or were disabled (72% of enrolled infants; 77% of control infants
and 56% of hypothermia-treated infants died or were
disabled; not significant); unlikely to reduce death/disability, score of 52: all infants died or were disabled
despite hypothermia (3% of enrolled infants). A score of
33 (95% CI: 30 –36) for infants receiving hypothermia,
chosen to maximize the sensitivity and specificity, had

83% sensitivity, 71% specificity, and a 76% correct classification rate for death/disability (Table 5).
For the death score, the score thresholds below which
all infants survived were 15 (95% CI: 11–19) in the
hypothermia group and 8 (95% CI: 2–15) in the control
group. Cutoff points of 8 (95% CI: 3–12), 15 (95% CI:
13–18), and 31 (95% CI: 27–35) divided the death score
(range: 4 – 45 for entire cohort) into 4 categories (Table
4), as follows: good prognosis, score of 8: survival even
without hypothermia (8% of all enrolled infants were in
this range); probable benefit, score of 8 to 15 (22% of
enrolled infants); possible benefit, score of 16 to 30
(68% of enrolled infants; 46% of control infants and
33% of hypothermia infants died; not significant); unlikely to reduce death, score of 31 (2% of enrolled
infants). A score of 18 (95% CI: 15–21) for infants
receiving hypothermia had 80% sensitivity, 75% specificity, and a 76% correct classification rate for death
(Table 6).
CART Models
The CART model for death/disability is shown in Fig 1
and that for death in Fig 2. The infant’s clinical data
determine the path down the decision tree that is to be
taken, and the incidence of the outcome in the terminal
node or box is the probability of the outcome for the
infant. The correct classification rates were improved
significantly for death/disability but not for death, compared with early neurologic examination, as determined
by the 95% CIs (Tables 5 and 6). The performances of
the CART models and the logistic regression-based scoring systems were comparable. The correct classification
rates were comparable in the hypothermia and control
groups (Tables 5 and 6). Predictive variables in order of
importance (higher on the decision tree) for death/disability included cord pH of 6.70 (91% death/morbidity) vs 6.70 (46%) (Fig 1). Among infants with cord pH
of 6.70, those without spontaneous activity had worse
outcomes (76% death/disability), compared with those
with such activity (32% death/disability). Infants with
some (normal/decreased) activity had worse outcomes if
the base deficit in the first arterial blood gas analysis was
18.5 mmol/L (55% vs 18% for 18.5 mmol/L) (Fig 1).
Predictors for death were base deficit in the first postnatal arterial blood gas analysis of 24.5 mmol/L (72%
death) vs 24.5 mmol/L (21%). For infants with base
deficits of 24.5 mmol/L, a cord pH of 6.74 predicted
worse outcomes (48% death vs 15% for pH of 6.74)
(Fig 2).
DISCUSSION
The scoring systems and the CART models were able to
classify correctly, with respect to death and death or
disability, 75% of infants with HIE and were comparable to or better than early neurologic examinations
alone. The decision trees and the scoring systems are
helpful for assessment of prognosis soon after birth and
may also be simpler for clinicians to use. Only a few

variables in the early neurologic examinations were actually associated with poor outcomes, and 2 blood gas
variables (cord pH and first postnatal arterial blood gas
base deficit) were identified as important predictors. Severe encephalopathy in early neurologic examinations
had slightly more than 50% sensitivity and classified
correctly only two thirds of infants for the outcome of
death/disability.
Strengths of this study include the relatively large
sample, recruited from multiple sites, and prospective
data collection by trained observers, both at birth and at
follow-up evaluations. In addition, rather than empirical
or expert opinion-derived scoring systems, we used variables associated statistically with the outcomes of interest and cutoff points for continuous variables that optimized discrimination between those with and without
these outcomes.
A limitation is that, despite the relatively large sample
size for this population, it was not feasible to use a
split-half cross-validation approach in which we could
develop the model in half of the data set and test it in the
other half. Therefore, these scoring systems and decision
trees need to be validated with other data sets. Also, as
with any clinical trial, only the variables that were considered to be important for the purposes of the trial were
collected, and other potentially important variables were
not collected in the first 6 hours (eg, biochemical variables such as serum or cerebrospinal fluid lactate levels,
electroencephalographic or cerebral blood flow recordings, or other clinical, laboratory, imaging, or special
investigation data). It must also be emphasized that none
of the models had correct classification rates close to
100%. Therefore, these models are suitable for risk stratification or assessment of prognosis but should not be a
basis for decisions regarding withdrawal of support. Infants evaluated in this study experienced a severe insult,
were admitted to tertiary care NICUs within 6 hours
after birth, and fulfilled strict eligibility criteria for entry

into the hypothermia trial. It is likely that infants who do
not have similar characteristics at admission have different outcomes, and the predictive value of the decision
trees and scoring systems may be substantially different
when applied to such infants. In any prognostic system,
certain variables (eg, pH and PCO2) are relatively objective, whereas others, such as those noted in clinical
examinations (eg, seizures), may be somewhat subjective, despite certification of examiners, leading to significant intercenter and inter-rater variations and variations in predictive ability across centers or clinicians. It is
probable that the accuracy of prediction could be improved by adding variables that are determined later in
the clinical course (eg, results of cranial imaging or clinical variables assessed closer to discharge). However, one
of the aims of our study was to determine whether we
could identify infants who would benefit from hypothermia, which needs to be initiated soon after birth to be
effective10; therefore, we used only early variables. Our
models are suitable for rapid assessment of sick neonates, because they rely mostly on objective measures
such as pH and base deficit, together with a few welldefined clinical findings that are available earlier and
may promote earlier identification and initiation of
treatment. A detailed neurologic or radiologic evaluation
is often difficult to perform for sick neonates, for whom
issues of stabilization (eg, airway and intravenous access) take precedence.
A comparison of the scoring systems based on logistic
regression and the CART models reveals that they have
similar accuracy. Regression analysis and classification
tree models in other direct comparisons have also been
noted to have comparable performance.15,16 However,
each approach has its advantages and disadvantages.
Logistic regression is often preferred when the objective
is to obtain explicit measures for statistical inference and
to identify the magnitude of the association between
each variable and the outcome.16 However, estimation of
the probability of the outcome for each patient with the
logistic regression equation is cumbersome and not easily applicable in the NICU. Therefore, we simplified the
process by developing a scoring system using odds ratios.
The scoring systems provide a numeric value that indicates the magnitude of risk (with a higher score indicating a higher risk). The CART model has fewer variables
and does not require any calculations; therefore, it may
be simpler to use for clinicians and ancillary staff members. However, CART models provide a qualitative answer (likely or not likely to have a poor outcome) and
not a quantitative result, and the magnitude of an individual’s risk is not as simple to determine as with the
scoring system. Treatment with hypothermia did not
lead to significant differences in the correct classification
rates for the scoring systems or the CART models, possibly because of limitations in sample size.
It is of interest to compare the variables selected for
the scoring systems and the CART analysis. Major contributors to the CART model for death/disability included cord pH, spontaneous activity, and base deficit of
the first postnatal blood gas analysis, and major contribFIGURE 2

utors to the scoring systems included posture, spontaneous activity, base deficit of the first postnatal blood gas
analysis, and 5-minute Apgar score. The CART models
for death had only base deficit of the first postnatal blood
gas analysis and cord pH, but major contributors to the
regression model included not only the base deficit but
also distal flexion/decerebrate posture and absent suck.
One of the useful observations from this study is that
not all of the components of the early neurologic examination (eg, level of consciousness, tone, Moro reflex,
pupils, heart rate, and respiration) contributed to determination of the prognosis. Abnormal posture, absent
spontaneous activity, and absent suck were the only
components that contributed significantly to prognosis.
Base deficit in the first postnatal arterial blood gas analysis was a variable that was important in both the scoring systems and CART models, and cord pH was also
important in the CART model. These results are consistent with previous studies that indicated that the severity of neurologic deficits is related to the degree and
duration of metabolic acidosis.17–19 In the CART model
for death/disability, infants with a cord pH of 6.7,
normal/decreased spontaneous activity, and a base deficit of 18.5 mmol/L had better outcomes if the PCO2 of
the cord blood gas was 87 mm Hg, compared with 87
mm Hg, which suggests that respiratory acidosis may be
associated with better outcomes in the absence of severe
metabolic acidosis. This finding is consistent with work
by Vannucci et al20 that showed that mild hypercapnia
was protective in immature rats with cerebral hypoxiaischemia.
Variables considered as risk factors for HIE, such as
antepartum hemorrhage and chronic hypertension/
pregnancy-induced hypertension, were associated with
reduced risks of death and/or morbidity in infants who
actually developed HIE. We speculate that this paradoxical phenomenon may be attributable to increased clinical vigilance or fetal adaptation. Ischemic preconditioning occurs in neonatal animals,21 and intermittent
episodes of cerebral ischemia in fetal sheep damage the
striatum without injuring the cortex as much.22
The scoring systems, both for death/disability and for
death, identified score ranges of infants who are most
likely to benefit from hypothermia. Because of the relatively small sample size and low power, the results of
these secondary analyses should be considered hypothesis-generating, rather than a basis for clinical practice.
In addition, the relationship of the scores to other clinical outcomes (eg, mild disability) and the effects of
hypothermia on those other outcomes have not been
determined. It is also possible that some survivors who
did not have moderate/severe disability at follow-up
assessments and who had low scores on our scoring
systems might have disabilities that become apparent
only at school age and potentially could have been attenuated by hypothermia. Very few infants had scores
high enough that benefit from hypothermia was unlikely. Therefore, our scoring systems are not suitable as
a tool for excluding infants from hypothermia.
CONCLUSIONS
Our scoring systems and CART models help in determination of the prognosis of infants with HIE and may be
useful in discussions of outcomes with parents and in
risk-stratification of infants in future clinical trials. It is
important to recognize that these models may be less
accurate for a future cohort or a different population,
and it is necessary to avoid self-fulfilling prophecies,
such as death attributable to withdrawal of support for
infants for whom a poor outcome is predicted. It is
known that obstetricians and pediatricians who underestimate the possibility of survival of a neonate are less
likely to use life-sustaining therapies such as resuscitation, mechanical ventilation, inotropic support, or other
standard therapies.23 With advances in perinatal care or
when infants with different characteristics are considered, these algorithms or the interpretations of the
scores will need modification to maintain their applicability.
